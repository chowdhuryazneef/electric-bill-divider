# electric-bill-divider
Python bot that takes in an excel file with a tally of the flat's electrical readings and convert it into individual, per-flat bills with the necessary info on them


First input asked is the .csv file with the list

Template is the form you want to create: 
A form is given, but use the codes (flatno, rate, etc.) to indicate where you want the bot to place the data. [.csv FILE MUST]

Horrible code, random thing. 
Not really something to see, but you can check out how it works.
